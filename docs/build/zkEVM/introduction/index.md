## What is Astar zkEVM?

Astar zkEVM is an Ethereum Layer-2 scaling solution leveraging Polygon's Chain Development Kit and cutting edge zero-knowledge cryptography to enable off-chain transaction execution, with finality and security guarantees provided by Ethereum. In coordination with our key partners, Astar zkEVM is well-positioned to take advantage of the extensive developer base and well-established toolset existing in the Ethereum ecosystem, based on the following key features:

- Higher TPS than Ethereum and Astar Substrate EVM due to rollup architecture - Transactions are parallelized and submitted on-chain in batches.   
- Lower Transaction Fees compared to Ethereum, also due to the above.
- Full EVM-equivalence - Not simply compatibility; equivilence. Smart contracts that work on Ethereum also work on Astar zkEVM.
- Native Account Abstraction - The Astar zkEVM aims to establish a new standard for UX and the user onboarding process, making it seamless. See the [Account Abstraction section](/docs/build/zkEVM/integrations/account-abstraction/) to learn about how to refine the end-user experience.
- Recognized Partners - Established names and brands developers trust power Astar zkEVM.
- Interoperability and Exposure - With zkEVM, we are supporting interoperability between Ethereum and Polkadot ecosystems, uniting communities through a common Multichain vision.
- Established Tools - Remix, Hardhat
